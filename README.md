Group Project Setup

Only one person needs to create the GitHub repo so choose someone to be the group leader and have them create a repo on GitHub.
The team lead will need to add the rest of the team as collaborators.
To do this, click on the settings tab and click on the Collaborators & Teams side menu.
Add the rest of the team by email or username. 
Everyone else on the team will need to clone the project to their local computers.
To do this, go the code (main screen) tab on the repo and click the green clone or download button on the right.
Make sure the title of new menu says Clone with SSH (if not click the link in the top corner that says use SSH) and grab the link in the text box.
On your local computer, make sure you are in the current directory you want the project to exist (dpl/week1) and type  git clone [SHH that you copied]
